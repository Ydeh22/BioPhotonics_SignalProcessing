# BioPhotonics_SignalProcessing
Nanostructure-based sensors are capable of sensitive and label-free detection for biomedical application. Capped gold nanoslit arrays made by thermal-embossing nanoimprint method on a polymer film can produce extremely sharp asymmetric resonances for a transverse magnetic-polarized waves, has the potential to achieve high-throughput biomedical detection.  However, such a method is still suffering for its signal to noise ratio, and therefore an extensive digital image processing or signal analysis techniques are required. This project aims to enhance the usability of Fano Resonances in biomedical application, particularly focuses on developing suitable methods for the digital signal processing
